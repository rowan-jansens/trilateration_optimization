# trilateration_optimization
Using 3+ satellites and a simple optimization algorithm to determine the position (x,y,z) of a point when giving the radius between the point and each satellite.

To view a 3d plot of the error function for x and y, use the command  $ gnuplot surface.p

To view a 2d plot of the error for each coordinate (x, y, z) use the command  $ gnuplot 2d.p
